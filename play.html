        <h4>THE EXCHANGE</h4>

        <h4>BY</h4>
            
        <h4>THURSTON</h4>

    <p>IMP. [_Interrupts and runs over to the railing, speaking soothingly to
    the_ JUDGE.] Excuse me, Judge, but maybe the lady would like deafness in
    exchange for her wrinkles. Deafness wouldn't show, so it couldn't spoil
    her face or her elegant figure.</p>

    <p> [_Wearily._] No, it won't show. Deafness ought to be a good thing
    for you.</p>

    <p> WOMAN. [_Consideringly._] Why--yes--that might do. But--well, it
    wouldn't show. I've a notion to take it. [_Pause--she seems to consider
    and meditate. The_ JUDGE _stares at her coldly_. IMP _grins impudently.
    She rises leisurely, sighs._] All right. I'll accept it.</p>

    <p> [_Sharply._] Hold up your right hand. [_She raises hand._] Do you
    swear to accept deafness for better or for worse, as your portion of the
    world's miseries, so help you God?</p>

    <p>VAIN WOMAN. [_Sweetly._] Oh, yes. I do, Judge.</p>

    <p>[_To_ IMP.] Show the lady to the changing-room.</p>

    <p>IMP. [_Escorts her to the curtained door with rather mock deference._]
    No, deafness won't show at all, and you'll have 'em all crazy about you.
    [_Draws aside curtains for her to pass._] Take second booth to your
    right.</p>
