        <h4>THE EXCHANGE</h4>

        <h4>BY</h4>
            
        <h4>ALTHEA THURSTON</h4>

    <h6 class="IMP">IMP.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Interrupts and runs over to the railing, speaking soothingly to
    the_ JUDGE.]</p> <p class="speech IMP"> Excuse me, Judge, but maybe the lady would like deafness in
    exchange for her wrinkles. Deafness wouldn't show, so it couldn't spoil
    her face or her elegant figure.</p>

    <p class="direction">[_Wearily._]</p> <p class=" speech IMP">No, it won't show. Deafness ought to be a good thing for you.</p>

    <h6 class="WOMAN">WOMAN.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Consideringly._]</p> <p class="speech WOMAN">Why--yes--that might do. But--well, 
    it wouldn't show. I've a notion to take it. <p class="direction">[_Pause--she seems to consider and meditate. The_ JUDGE _stares at her coldly_.
    IMP _grins impudently. She rises leisurely, sighs._]</p> <p class="speech  WOMAN"> All right. I'll accept it.</p>

    <h6 class="JUDGE">JUDGE.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Sharply._]</p>  <p class="speech JUDGE">Hold up your right hand. <p class="direction">[_She raises hand._]</p> 
    <p class="speech JUDGE">Do you swear to accept deafness for better or for worse, as your portion of the
    world's miseries, so help you God?</p>

    <h6 class="VAIN WOMAN">VAIN WOMAN.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Sweetly._]</p> <p class="speech VAIN WOMAN">Oh, yes. I do, Judge.</p>

    <h6 class="JUDGE">JUDGE.</h6> <p class="direction">[_To_ IMP.]</p>  <p class="speech JUDGE">Show the lady to the changing-room.</p>

    <h6 class="IMP">IMP.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Escorts her to the curtained door with rather mock deference._]</p>
    <p class="speech IMP">No, deafness won't show at all, and you'll have 'em all crazy about you.</p>
    <p class="direction">[_Draws aside curtains for her to pass._] Take second booth to your right.</p>
        
    <p class="direction">[VAIN WOMAN _stands posing a moment. She smiles radiantly and pats
     her cheeks softly with her hands, then with a long-drawn sigh of
     happiness, she exits._ IMP _bows low and mockingly after her
     vanishing form, his hand on his heart_].</p>

    <h6 class="JUDGE">JUDGE.<h6> <p class="direction">[_Sarcastically._]</p> 
    <p class="speech JUDGE"> Do her faults or shortcomings trouble her? Not
    at all! Perfectly satisfied with herself, except for a few wrinkles in her face. Vain women! Bah!</p>

    <h6 class="IMP">IMP.</h6> <p class="speech IMP">Yes, sir; women have queer notions.</p>

     <p class="direction">[_An imperative rap at the street-door, immediately followed by the
     rapper's abrupt entrance. We see an important-appearing personage.
     His arrogant bearing and commanding pose lead us to believe that he
     is accustomed to prompt attention. It is the_ RICH CITIZEN,
     _exceedingly well groomed. His manner is lordly, but he addresses
     the_ JUDGE _in a bored tone. When_ IMP _scampers to meet him, the_
     RICH CITIZEN _hands him his hat and cane and turns at once to the_
     JUDGE. IMP _examines the hat and cane critically, hangs them on the
     hat-rack, and returns to his desk, where he again perches to watch
     the_ RICH CITIZEN.</p>

    <h6 class="CITIZEN">CITIZEN.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Lighting a cigarette._]</p>  <p class="speech CITIZEN">I am addressing the Judge, am I not?</p>
